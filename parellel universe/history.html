        <h1>History of Parallel Universe Theories</h1>
        <p>The concept of parallel universes or alternate realities has a long history and has been explored in various forms by different cultures throughout time. Here are more detailed historical theories and beliefs related to parallel worlds:</p>

        <h2>Greek Mythology</h2>
        <p>Greek mythology featured the belief in a vast multiverse. The ancient Greeks imagined a cosmos composed of multiple realms, including Earth, the Underworld, and Mount Olympus, the dwelling place of the gods. Humans could access these otherworldly realms through extraordinary feats, such as heroic journeys. The Greek philosopher Empedocles even speculated about the existence of other worlds beyond our own, each with its own inhabitants and characteristics.</p>

        <h2>Roman Mythology</h2>
        <p>Roman mythology closely mirrored Greek mythology, and the Romans shared a similar worldview. They believed in a multitude of deities and parallel dimensions, each with its unique attributes. Roman mythology emphasized the concept of "genius loci," the protective spirits associated with specific locations. These spirits were believed to inhabit different realms, making the natural world itself a portal to otherworldly experiences.</p>

        <h2>Hindu Cosmology</h2>
        <p>Hinduism's rich cosmology includes an elaborate system of dimensions and realms. In Hindu belief, the universe is divided into three primary lokas (worlds): Svarga (heaven), Bhumi (earth), and Patala (the underworld). Additionally, there are various planes, or lokas, each with its own distinct characteristics and inhabitants. The concept of "Samsara" involves the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, allowing souls to travel through these different realms in their spiritual journey.</p>
